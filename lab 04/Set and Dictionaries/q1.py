'''Capital Quiz
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys and their capitals as
values. (Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.) The program should then
randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user to enter that stateâ€™s
capital. The program should keep a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses. (As
an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of countries and their capitals.)
